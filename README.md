## Getting Started

Hi there,
under testcafe you will find a file called test.spec.js. This file contains one almost complete test that you need to correct and 4 that you need to write yourself.
In this exmaple we are using a Javascript framework called Testcafe. And you are allowed to use Testcafes documentation [https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/reference/] .
This testsuit should test a webshop [https://www.saucedemo.com/]. On the login page you find credentioals that you need to use to complete all tests.
Good luck!
